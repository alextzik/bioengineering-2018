The project consisted of spike recognition and classification. A method for identifying spikes was first required. The extraction of characteristics for correct classification of each spike as activity of a specific neutron was then completed.

## Comments

To test Q2.4 & Q2.5 faster:

- comment Q2.4, Q2.5
- run the script
- execute `save 'eval-data.mat'` into workspace
- comment Q2.1 to Q2.3 and add `load('eval-data.mat');` before Q2.4
